On DockerHub is now hosting an official 
[CometVisu container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cometvisu/cometvisu).
It can be obtained by the usual `docker pull cometvisu/cometvisu`.

The tag `latest` will allways reference to the latest released version, as of
today `0.10.2`.

Next to the releases are containers corresponding to the latest development
version. The tag `testing` references to a version identical to the `develop`
branch of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu/) and
will be automatically built each time new code gets pulled there.  
To be able to bisect between code changes older versions of the code are also
available in containers with the tags `testing-<date>`.  
This is additional to the already available
[nightly builds](https://bintray.com/cometvisu/CometVisu/CometVisu/nightlies)
of the CometVisu.
