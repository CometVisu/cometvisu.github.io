To have a more easy start with the CometVisu you can now follow the tutorial
for the first steps. It shows you how the first visualisation can be created
within half a minute.  
It is followed by a few more steps to enhance it to a fully functional heating
control.

When you are currently building your home and have no spare time you will get
an easy to follow solution - that can also be the base for your full featured
visu when you have time for it.

The tutorial can be watched at YouTube:

The single steps, detailed with lots of screenshots, can be followed up in the manual:
