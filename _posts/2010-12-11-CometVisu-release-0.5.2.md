A new release of the CometVisu has just been tagged in SVN and was uploaded to the files section.

It comes with quite a few exciting features:

- New Feature: Plugins
- New Plugin: colorChooser (based on farbtastic)
- New Plugin: diagrams
- New Feature: user settable status bar (i.e. footer)
- New Feature: iframe widget

This release was aimed to create a stable basis as now a few important details of the internal implementation of the CometVisu will be refactored. This will also result in partly incompatible config files.

It is planned to publish a public beta shortly after the refactoring.
