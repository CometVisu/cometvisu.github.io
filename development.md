Development
===========

The CometVisu is only possible through the work of many:

{{ contributorsTable }}

The development discussions happen at the [KNX User Forum](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/cometvisu)
(German spoken, but English is fine, too) as well as on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/CometVisu/CometVisu_DE). 
The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu).

To also start development only a [fork](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu#fork-destination-box)
of the repository is needed. Detailed information for developers are given
in the [CometVisu Wiki](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu/wiki) on GitHub.

The latest manual for the development version (nightly build) can is located
at [http://www.cometvisu.org/CometVisu/en/latest/manual/](http://www.cometvisu.org/CometVisu/en/latest/manual/)
and a [nightly build](https://bintray.com/cometvisu/CometVisu/CometVisu/nightlies#files)
of the code is also available.
