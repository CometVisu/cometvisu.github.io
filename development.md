Development
===========

The CometVisu is only possibly by the work of many:

{{ contributorsTable }}

The development discussions happen at the [KNX User Forum](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/cometvisu)
(German spoken, but English is fine, too) as well as on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/CometVisu/CometVisu_DE). 
The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu).

To also start development only a [fork](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu#fork-destination-box)
of the repository is needed. Detailed information for developers are given
in the [CometVisu Wiki](https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu/wiki) on GitHub.
